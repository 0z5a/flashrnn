# Complete synthetic stacked-model sequence inference

Fixed random weights and request IDs in torch.float16; this is a full 4-layer model workload, not a pretrained checkpoint or autoregressive generation result. Throughput is completed sequence responses/s. Timed scope includes host-to-device IDs, embedding, recurrence, readout, device-to-host logits and queued groups. Compilation, model construction and qualification are excluded.
